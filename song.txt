I Read You Like an Open Book - Tages

In the text words from the past
Hold down the pain to keep what's fast
In reality to come what may,
Knowing what you really say
You make your life just like a play
Like I knew before would come the future

I hold on within your part
Ever more I need your heart
In reality to come what may
Knowing what you really say
You make your life just like a play
Like I knew before would come the future

Hey, hey, hey
I read you like an open book, so don't you lie
I like to take a closer look, you stand and wonder why

Now you know just what I say
Try and find some other way
In reality to come what may
Knowing what you really say
You make your life just like a play
Like I knew before would come the future

Hey, hey, hey
I read you like an open book, so don't you lie
I like to take a closer look, you stand and wonder why

Hey, hey, hey
I read you like an open book, so don't you lie
I like to take a closer look, you stand and wonder why

Hey, hey, hey
I like to take an open book, so don't you lie
I like to take a closer look, you stand and wonder why

Hey, hey, hey
I read you like an open book
